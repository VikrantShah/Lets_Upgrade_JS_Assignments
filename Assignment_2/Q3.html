            Datatypes in Javascript

            <h2>
                Primitive Datatypes :-
            </h2>
        </li>

        <ol>
            <h3>
                <li>
                    Number -
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Represents both integers and floating point numbers. Many operations can be performed on numbers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. <br> There are special numeric values that, also belong to this datatype such as "Infinity", "-Infinity" and "NaN".
            </p>

            <h3>
                <li>
                    BigInt -
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                In Javascript, the number datatype cannot represent positive numbers greater than (2<sup>53</sup> - 1) or the negative numbers less than -(2<sup>53</sup> - 1). This technical limitation is caused by some internal representation. <br> Most of the purpose is fulfilled by this limit but, in some cases we require to work with really large numbers. <br> BigInt was introduced to represent numbers of arbitary length. A BigInt is created by appending <b>n</b> to the end of integer.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <li>
                    String -
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                In Javascript, string is represented in the quotes. It can be either single or double qoutes i.e. If the string is started wkith single quote, it should end with single qoutes only. Same goes for double quotes.
            </p>
            <h3>
                <li>
                    Boolean -
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Boolean or logical type can store only two values, either true or false.<br> true means/represents yes or 1.<br> false means/represents no or 0.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <li>
                    null -
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is a special/seperate type which doesn't matches with any other datatype. It represents "nothing", "empty" or "unknown value".
            </p>

            <h3>
                <li>
                    undefined -
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is also a special type of value/datatype which stands apart from any other value. It means the "any value is not assigned to it".<br> If a variable is declared but, not assigned, then it's value is undefined.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <li>
            <h2>
                Non-Primitive Datatypes :-

        <ol>
            <h3>
                <li>
                    Object -
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Object represents instance of a class through, which we can access the class members.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <li>
                    Array - 
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Array can store group of similar type of value. Multiple values can be stored in a single variable.
            </p>

            <h3>
                <li>
                    RegExp -
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Regular Expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. Searching pattens can be used for text manipulation and text search. It can be single character or a very complex pattern.
