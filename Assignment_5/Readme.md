# Assignment 5

<br><br>
## Question 1 :
Create a for loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at multiples of 5 and
"fizzbuzz" at multiples of 3 and 5.

<br><br>
## Question 2 :

<br><br>
## Question 3 :
Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping.
<br><br>
So you have an array called shoppingList with all the products you want to buy.
<br><br>
Now that you are inside of the shop, you have a basket with all the products from your list, but you want to
add a few more. 
<br><br>
Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the shoppingList array, and add some
new products into it.

<br><br>
## Question 4 :
Make a Calculator in Javascript which can do operations as Addtion, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division,
Square root, Percentage.

<br><br>
## Question 5 :
You are managing a sales department for your company, you want to reward your employees based on
the sales made by them during the year.
<br><br>
The criteria is as follows:

  1. Sales from 0-5000 : 2% 
  2. Sales from 5001 - 10000 : 5%
  3. Sales from 10001 - 20000 : 7%
  4. Above 20000 - 10% 

Then log the total commission earned by him.

<br><br>
## Question 6 :
Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them
to input again.
<br><br>
The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the
input/enters an empty line.
<br><br>
Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special
handling for a non-numeric input in this task.

<br><br>
## Querstion 7 :
An integer number greater than 1 is called a [prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
except 1 and itself.
<br><br>
In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.
<br><br>
For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.
<br><br>
**Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.**
<br><br>
For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.
<br><br>
P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value

<br><br>
## Question 8 :
Replace Function Expressions with arrow functions in the code below:
